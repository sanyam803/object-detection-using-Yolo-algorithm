# #object-detection-using-Yolo-algorithm
It is a classic implementation of yolo algorithm using tensorflow for object detection .
The Algorithm has been used for autonomus driving as it is used to detect object by the vehicle.
The objects include cars,traffic lights,pedestrains and can further be expanded to detect many other objects.
